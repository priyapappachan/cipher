Cipher Texts

A lot of people are snooping on you and reading your texts. You plan to encrypt it using a transposition cipher. Write a program that can both encrypt and decrypt the messages. It will accept a string, and a choice of whether to encrypt or decrypt it. 

Transposition cipher works by changing the position of the letters in the sentence. Break down the sentence into a square [Floor value. For 9 characters it is 3x3, for 12 it is 3x3 + 3, for 14 it is 3x3 + 5] (If there are extra characters, add them to the bottom of the square and convert them to *) and use the algorithm to get the encrypted and decrypted text.

For Example:
“lets go geocaching” can be broken into :

l e t s
g o g e 
o c a c 
h i n g

The encrypted text will be lgoheocitgansecg.

HRUNDOEDGEWYOD*AOIU* can be broken into :

H R U N D
O E D G E
W Y O D *
A O I U *

The decrypted text will be HOWAREYOUDOINGDUDE.
